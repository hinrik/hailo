0.20

    - Use Mouse instead of Moose by default. This saves about 8MB of
      resident memory bringing Hailo's memory usage with SQLite from
      28MB to 20MB. Startup time is also reduced with the test suite
      running around 46% faster.

    - Drop MouseX::Role::Strict / MooseX::Role::Strict. Spotted when
      switching to Moose but mainly we just didn't care about using
      it.

    - Word tokenizer: Improve punctuation when words are split with '/'

0.19 Sat Feb 27 04:23:03 GMT 2010
    - Move File::Slurp from 'requires' to 'test_requires'

    - Make the default pragma logic a bit simpler

    - MySQL backend: Don't make host a required storage_args argument,
      MySQL will use localhost by default.

    - MySQL backend: Document collation settings that have to be right
      for Hailo not to blow up.

    - Fix some capitalization/punctuation issues of words with dashes/quotes

    - A new hailo-benchmark-replies utility and documentation in
      Hailo.pm about its results.

0.18 Fri Feb 26 05:02:17 GMT 2010

    - Don't keep the brain in memory by default anymore, but enable some
      safety-sacrificing performance optimizations instead

    - DBD::SQLite backend: It's now possible to set any PRAGMA SQLite
      supports at the start of the connection by supplying C<pragma_*>
      parameters in in C<storage_args>. See
      Hailo::Storage::DBD::SQLite documentation for more info.

    - Issue #28: Implement a ready() method for backends. This
      un-breaks the command-line interface with non-SQLite backends.

    - Word tokenizer: Fix capitalization of the first word in some cases

    - Add more exhaustive tests for the Word tokenizer. 

    - Un-break t/storage/DBD-mysql.t test

    - Never test PostgreSQL / MySQL unless explicitly told to do so.

0.17 Tue Feb 23 04:06:50 GMT 2010
    - Remove all storage engines that weren't DBD::*. I.e. the Perl
      backend and the flat Perl::Flat & CHI::* backends.

      These backends were added to experiment with alternate backends,
      but between them they had no redeeming quality aside from
      increasing our number of backends & tests. The downside is that
      we constantly had to deal with errors in these backends that
      weren't present in our primary DBD::* targets.

    - Remove Log::Log4perl. We weren't using it for anything except
      printing one log line. Maybe we'll add it in the future with
      proper support. See Issue #15.

    - Hailo now uses less memory by lazy-loading various modules that
      it previously loaded even if they were redundant.

    - Issue #12: --not-a-valid-option now prints the same help output
      --help would. MooseX::Getopt::Basic is evil and hard to override
      so this is done with some hackery.

    - Renamed Hailo::Storage::Mixin::DBD to Hailo::Storage::DBD, since
      mixin is really a misnomer for this base class.

    - Improved documentation including a new SYNOPSIS with examples.

    - Error on training with an undef argument.

    - t/storage/dbd-switch-order.t didn't clean up the tempfile it was
      using.

    - More capitalization improvements.

0.16 Mon Feb 22 17:08:46 GMT 2010
    - Don't seed a reply with a token which is too rare
    - Make the Word tokenizer split "example.com" into 3 tokens, while still
      keeping "3.14" as one token. Also accept ',' as a decimal point.
    - Various improvements to capitalization in the Word tokenizer
    - Don't run the ReadLine UI if --stats is supplied
    - Allow keeping the entire SQLite database in memory while running
    - Make that the default behavior to reduce IO
    - Declare undeclared File::Slurp dependency
    - Declare undeclared Test::Script dependency
    - Fixed utf8 problems with ReadLine UI
    - Optimize the SQL schema bit, which shaves about 10% off the size of
      the DB and cuts more than half of the time needed to generate a reply

0.15 Thu Feb 18 23:55:19 GMT 2010
    - Allow specifying SQLite's cache size with --storage-args
    - Reduce likelhood of returning a reply which is identical to the input
    - Instead of depending on version "0" of most modules (i.e. any
      version) depend on the latest CPAN version. We know this works;
      but we have no idea if the older modules work.
    - Changed to word tokenizer so that it doesn't return whitespace tokens,
      instead returning a flag which dictatesthe whitespace policy of the
      token in question. Changed the default Markov order to 2 to compensate.
    - Fixed a bug with the DBD::* backends not retrieving the Markov order
      from an existing database
    - Removed Text::Trim dependency due to it not being acceptable for Debian
    - Learn from the input when using the ReadLine UI
    - Removed Test::Exit hard dependency for tests: Not in Debian yet
    - Added a --stats option to print some statistics about the brain

0.14 Sat Feb 13 17:07:30 GMT 2010
    - Fixed a bug in the test suite preventing optional backends from
      being tested
    - All tests now use Hailo::Test, consequently backends now go
      through much more thorough testing. Lots of other test related
      since from 0.13.
    - utils/hailo-benchmark: Rewritten to use Hailo::Test, the
      benchmark is now more representive of actual Hailo usage.
    - Hailo->learn() can now take an arrayref

0.13 Sat Feb 13 09:19:52 GMT 2010
    - Add missing .trn files to the test suite
    - Fix number of tests in t/storage/all.t

0.12 Sat Feb 13 08:55:25 GMT 2010
    - If asked for a reply before we've learned anything, return nothing
      instead of spewing warnings
    - Issue #19: Ability to ->train() from filehandle as well as from
      a file
    - Re-enable t/bug/tokens-repeat.t test disabled in
      cc189bd7a2dc56561c71868f061307ee5068f904
    - When replying to some input, pay more attention to rare tokens
    - Hailo::Storage::Mixin::Hash would inevitably die due to not importing uniq()
    - Allow Hailo->train() to take an arrayref, filename, or filehandle argument

0.11 Fri Feb 12 09:44:13 GMT 2010
    - Corrected outdated documentation in some places
    - Fixed a problem with the SQLite backend not reading some information
      from an existing brain if reply() is called first
    - Fix --reply option, its argument was being ignored

0.10 Fri Feb 12 02:31:34 GMT 2010
    - Normalized the SQL schema some more. This breaks compatability with old
      brains of course, but training/learning is quite a bit faster now.
    - Removed Hailo::Engine and moved most of its logic into the storage
      backends
    - Fixed module loader picking Perl::Flat when Perl was requested
    - Always return a reply, even when input tokens are unknown or missing

0.09 Thu Feb 11 02:36:49 GMT 2010
    - Disable SQLite's journal while training. Speeds up long imports.
    - Add Perl::Flat backend which keeps things in a simple key-value
      hash where key and value are both Str. It can be subclassed to
      store data in e.g. BerkeleyDB, Cache or other key-value
      backends.
    - Add CHI backend with File, Memory, BerkeleyDB etc. backends
    - Use MooseX::Role::Strict instead of Moose::Role
    - Use Log::Log4perl for logging
    - SQLite broke if using a :memory: brain if a :memory: file existed
    - Use Module::Pluggable for finding plugins

0.08 Wed Feb 10 00:06:20 GMT 2010
    - 0.07 broke the PostgreSQL and MySQL backend. Fixed them.
    - Made it less likely that non-SQLite backends will be broken in
      the future by moving the DB-specific SQL out of Pg.pm and
      mysql.pm into macros in SQL.pm
    - Use of $. in Hailo.pm broke file-based backends such as Cache.pm
    - Make MySQL docs copy-pasteable 
    - Add a benchmark script as utils/hailo-benchmark

0.07 Tue Feb  9 15:23:44 GMT 2010
    - Note: The storage backends for this release have been changed in such
      a way that it is incompatible with brains created by older releases
    - Add missing dependencies on Test::Script/MX::Getopt::Dashes
    - The Words tokenizer now compresses whitespace when tokenizing as
      well as whitespace-trimming the output it produces
    - Make start/end expressions only start/end sentences most of the time
      instead of all the time
    - Issue #13: `hailo -b brain' will launch an interactive ReadLine
      terminal
    - Don't exit() on print_version=> in run(), just return()
    - Add $VERSION to all .pm files
    - Use namespace::clean everywhere

0.06 Sat Jan 30 19:21:28 GMT 2010
    - Construct SQL's dbd_options with lazy_build, not default. This
      makes it easy to add additional options in the individual
      storage engines.
    - Remove some dead code in Hailo::Storage::Perl
    - Explicitly disconnect sqlite's dbh / sth handles. This should
      fix some cpantesters FAILs we're getting which print "database
      is locked" errors.

0.05 Sat Jan 30 13:55:18 GMT 2010
    - Shuffle key tokens and don't reuse them. Should make for more random
      replies.
    - Check for definedness of $self->brain in Hailo::Storage::*
    - Use autodie to catch open/close errors
    - Hailo->learn() was broken when print_progress was false
    - Add tests for Hailo invocation
    - Use MooseX::StrictConstructor

0.04 Fri Jan 29 17:48:49 GMT 2010
    - You know that bug we talked about being fixed in 0.03? It was
      still there now it's actually fixed.
    - Use Class::MOP::load_class() instead of eval { require $str } to load plugins
    - Depend on Perl 5.10
    - Added MySQL storage backend, don't use it.

0.03 Fri Jan 29 14:37:17 GMT 2010
    - Fixed a fatal error in Hailo::Engine::Default that would
      inevitable occur on any large brain. When Hailo was given
      repeating input with such as [ qw(badger ! badger !) ] where
      the probability of all the given token following each other was
      100% (i.e. there's nothing to break the loop) it would start
      generating infinitely long replies.
  
      This was fixed by adding a guard clause in Hailo::Engine::Default
      which breaks the loop if we're up to C<$order * 10> and the
      number of unique tokens in the reply is less than the model
      C<$order>.

0.02 Fri Jan 29 03:54:32 GMT 2010
    - Fix typo in NAME in Hailo::Tokenizer::Words which caused the POD
      not to be displayed on search.cpan.org
    - Present options in --help output in reverse sort order
    - Add facility to pass arguments to storage/engine/tokenizer from
      the command line or via Hailo->new(). Make Hailo::Storage::Pg
      use this facility for its database connection arguments.
    - Fix spelling error in Hailo's POD
    - --reply on the command line didn't work

0.01 Fri Jan 29 00:39:54 GMT 2010
    - First CPAN release
