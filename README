NAME
    Hailo - A pluggable Markov engine analogous to MegaHAL

SYNOPSIS
     use strict;
     use warnings;
     use Hailo;

     my $hailo = Hailo->new(
         # Or Pg, or Perl ...
         storage_class  => 'SQLite',
         brain_resource => 'brain.db'
     );

     while (<>) {
         $hailo->learn($_);
         say $hailo->reply($_);
     }

DESCRIPTION
    Hailo is a fast and lightweight markov engine intended to replace
    AI::MegaHAL. It has a lightweight Moose-based core with pluggable
    storage and tokenizer backends.

    It is similar to MegaHAL in functionality, the main differences (with
    the default backends) being better scalability, drastically less memory
    usage, an improved tokenizer, and tidier output.

    With this distribution, you can create, modify, and query Hailo brains.
    To use Hailo in event-driven POE applications, you can use the
    POE::Component::Hailo wrapper. One example is
    POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Hailo, which implements an IRC chat bot.

  Etymology
    *Hailo* is a portmanteau of *HAL* (as in MegaHAL) and failo
    <http://identi.ca/failo>.

ATTRIBUTES
  "brain_resource"
    The name of the resource (file name, database name) to use as storage.
    There is no default.

  "order"
    The Markov order (chain length) you want to use for an empty brain. The
    default is 5.

  "storage_class"
    The storage backend to use. Default: 'SQLite'.

    This gives you an idea of approximately how the backends compare in
    speed:

    To run your own test try running utils/hailo-benchmark in the Hailo
    distribution.

  "tokenizer_class"
    The tokenizer to use. Default: 'Words';

  "ui_class"
    The UI to use. Default: 'ReadLine';

  "storage_args"
  "tokenizer_args"
  "ui_args"
    A "HashRef" of arguments storage/tokenizer/ui backends. See the
    documentation for the backends for what sort of arguments they accept.

  "token_separator"
    Storage backends may choose to store the tokens of an expression as a
    single string. If so, they will be joined them together with a
    separator. By default, this is "\t".

METHODS
  "new"
    This is the constructor. It accepts the attributes specified in
    "ATTRIBUTES".

  "run"
    Run the application according to the command line arguments.

  "learn"
    Takes a string or an array reference of strings, and learns from them.

  "train"
    Takes a filename, filehandle or array reference and learns from all its
    lines. If a filename is passed, the file is assumed to be UTF-8 encoded.
    Unlike "learn", this method sacrifices some safety (disables the
    database journal, fsyncs, etc) for speed while learning.

  "reply"
    Takes an optional line of text and generates a reply that might be
    relevant.

  "learn_reply"
    Takes a string argument, learns from it, and generates a reply that
    might be relevant.

  "save"
    Tells the underlying storage backend to save its state.

CAVEATS
    All occurences of "token_separator" will be stripped from your input
    before it is processed, so make sure it's set to something that is
    unlikely to appear in it.

    You can join the IRC channel *#hailo* on FreeNode if you have questions.
