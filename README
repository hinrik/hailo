NAME
    Hailo - A pluggable Markov engine analogous to MegaHAL

SYNOPSIS
    This is the synopsis for using Hailo as a module. See hailo for
    command-line invocation.

     # Hailo requires Perl 5.10
     use 5.010;
     use strict;
     use warnings;
     use Hailo;

     # Construct a new in-memory Hailo using the SQLite backend. See
     # backend documentation for other options.
     my $hailo = Hailo->new;

     # Various ways to learn
     my @train_this = qw< I like big butts and I can not lie >;
     $hailo->learn(\@train_this);
     $hailo->learn($_) for @train_this;

     # Heavy-duty training interface. Backends may drop some safety
     # features like journals or synchronous IO to train faster using
     # this mode.
     $hailo->learn("megahal.trn");
     $hailo->learn($filehandle);

     # Make the brain babble
     say $hailo->reply("hello good sir.");

DESCRIPTION
    Hailo is a fast and lightweight markov engine intended to replace
    AI::MegaHAL. It has a Mouse (or Moose) based core with pluggable storage
    and tokenizer backends.

    It is similar to MegaHAL in functionality, the main differences (with
    the default backends) being better scalability, drastically less memory
    usage, an improved tokenizer, and tidier output.

    With this distribution, you can create, modify, and query Hailo brains.
    To use Hailo in event-driven POE applications, you can use the
    POE::Component::Hailo wrapper. One example is
    POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Hailo, which implements an IRC chat bot.

  Etymology
    *Hailo* is a portmanteau of *HAL* (as in MegaHAL) and failo
    <http://identi.ca/failo>.

Backends
    Hailo supports pluggable storage and tokenizer backends, it also
    supports a pluggable UI backend which is used by the hailo command-line
    utility.

  Storage
    Hailo can currently store its data in either a SQLite, PostgreSQL or
    MySQL database, more backends were supported in earlier versions but
    they were removed as they had no redeeming quality.

    SQLite is the primary target for Hailo. It's much faster and uses less
    resources than the other two. It's highly recommended that you use it.

    This benchmark shows how the backends compare when training on the small
    testsuite dataset as reported by the utils/hailo-benchmark utility
    (found in the distribution):

                             Rate DBD::Pg DBD::mysql DBD::SQLite/file DBD::SQLite/memory
        DBD::Pg            2.22/s      --       -33%             -49%               -56%
        DBD::mysql         3.33/s     50%         --             -23%               -33%
        DBD::SQLite/file   4.35/s     96%        30%               --               -13%
        DBD::SQLite/memory 5.00/s    125%        50%              15%                 --

    Under real-world workloads SQLite is much faster than these results
    indicate since the time it takes to train/reply is relative to the
    existing database size. Here's how long it took to train on a 214,710
    line IRC log on a Linode 1080 with Hailo 0.18:

    *   SQLite

         real    8m38.285s
         user    8m30.831s
         sys     0m1.175s

    *   MySQL

         real    48m30.334s
         user    8m25.414s
         sys     4m38.175s

    *   PostgreSQL

         real    216m38.906s
         user    11m13.474s
         sys     4m35.509s

    In the case of PostgreSQL it's actually much faster to first train with
    SQLite, dump that database and then import it with psql(1), see failo's
    README <http://github.com/hinrik/failo> for how to do that.

    However when replying with an existing database (using
    utils/hailo-benchmark-replies) yields different results. SQLite can
    reply really quickly without being warmed up (which is the typical
    usecase for chatbots) but once PostgreSQL and MySQL are warmed up they
    start replying faster:

    Here's a comparison of doing 10 replies:

                            Rate PostgreSQL MySQL SQLite-file SQLite-file-28MB SQLite-memory
        PostgreSQL        71.4/s         --  -14%        -14%             -29%          -50%
        MySQL             83.3/s        17%    --          0%             -17%          -42%
        SQLite-file       83.3/s        17%    0%          --             -17%          -42%
        SQLite-file-28MB 100.0/s        40%   20%         20%               --          -30%
        SQLite-memory      143/s       100%   71%         71%              43%            --

    In this test MySQL uses around 28MB of memory (using Debian's
    my-small.cnf) and PostgreSQL around 34MB. Plain SQLite uses 2MB of cache
    but it's also tested with 28MB of cache as well as with the entire
    database in memory.

    But doing 10,000 replies is very different:

                           Rate SQLite-file PostgreSQL SQLite-file-28MB MySQL SQLite-memory
        SQLite-file      85.1/s          --        -7%             -18%  -27%          -38%
        PostgreSQL       91.4/s          7%         --             -12%  -21%          -33%
        SQLite-file-28MB  103/s         21%        13%               --  -11%          -25%
        MySQL             116/s         37%        27%              13%    --          -15%
        SQLite-memory     137/s         61%        50%              33%   18%            --

    Once MySQL gets more memory (using Debian's my-large.cnf) and a chance
    to warm it starts yielding better results (I couldn't find out how to
    make PostgreSQL take as much memory as it wanted):

                       Rate         MySQL SQLite-memory
        MySQL         121/s            --          -12%
        SQLite-memory 138/s           14%            --

  Tokenizer
    By default Hailo will use the word tokenizer to split up input by
    whitespace, taking into account things like quotes, sentence terminators
    and more.

    There's also a the character tokenizer. It's not generally useful for a
    conversation bot but can be used to e.g. generate new words given a list
    of existing words.

ATTRIBUTES
  "brain_resource"
    The name of the resource (file name, database name) to use as storage.
    There is no default. Whether this gets used at all depends on the
    storage backend, currently only SQLite uses it.

  "save_on_exit"
    A boolean value indicating whether Hailo should save its state before
    its object gets destroyed. This defaults to true and will simply call
    save at "DEMOLISH" time.

  "order"
    The Markov order (chain length) you want to use for an empty brain. The
    default is 2.

  "storage_class"
    The storage backend to use. Default: 'SQLite'.

  "tokenizer_class"
    The tokenizer to use. Default: 'Words';

  "ui_class"
    The UI to use. Default: 'ReadLine';

  "storage_args"
  "tokenizer_args"
  "ui_args"
    A "HashRef" of arguments for storage/tokenizer/ui backends. See the
    documentation for the backends for what sort of arguments they accept.

METHODS
  "new"
    This is the constructor. It accepts the attributes specified in
    "ATTRIBUTES".

  "learn"
    Takes a string or an array reference of strings and learns from them.

  "train"
    Takes a filename, filehandle or array reference and learns from all its
    lines. If a filename is passed, the file is assumed to be UTF-8 encoded.
    Unlike "learn", this method sacrifices some safety (disables the
    database journal, fsyncs, etc) for speed while learning.

  "reply"
    Takes an optional line of text and generates a reply that might be
    relevant.

  "learn_reply"
    Takes a string argument, learns from it, and generates a reply that
    might be relevant. This is equivalent to calling learn followed by
    reply.

  "save"
    Tells the underlying storage backend to save its state, any arguments to
    this method will be passed as-is to the backend.

  "stats"
    Takes no arguments. Returns the number of tokens, expressions, previous
    token links and next token links.

SUPPORT
    You can join the IRC channel *#hailo* on FreeNode if you have questions.

    tracker on Github <http://github.com/hinrik/hailo/issues>.

PRIVATE METHODS
  "run"
    Run Hailo in accordance with the the attributes that were passed to it,
    this method is called by the hailo command-line utility and the Hailo
    test suite, it's behavior is subject to change.
